# PanelApp_Pipeline

This pipeline is divided into two parts. The first part describes three scripts that has been designed to scrape PanelApp Australia, downloading every version of every panel and summarising this information (Scripts 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3).

The second set of scripts are focused on comparing panels, and examining how they have changed over time.

In addition to these scripts, an the code used to generate the figures used in this report are attached here too.
