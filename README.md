<h1> PADA-WAN: A pipeline designed to download and analyse the information from PanelApp Web Applications. </h1>

*** PanelApp Downloader, Analyser - Web Application Navigator (PADA-WAN) *** is a series of custom python scripts designed to download the information from either PanelApp or PanelApp Australia and characterise how each panel has evolved over a period of time. This pipeline was developed for Evolution of virtual gene panels over time and implications for genomic data re-analysis (Robertson et al., 2023)

# System requirements
PADA-WAN requires Python/3.9.13, and R/3.5.0 .

PADA-WAN has been tested on a local, desktop computer (MacOS 13.3.1) and a cluster computer ________.

## Python dependencies
- pandas 1.1.5
- numpy 1.19.5

- ggplot2 

# PADA-WAN Overview 
 
 PADA-WAN is made of two parts. 
 
 ***Part 1*** is responsible for downloading and summarising the information from PanelApp
 
 ***Part 2*** focuses on characterising change and an option set of R scripts makes it possible to visualise these changes
